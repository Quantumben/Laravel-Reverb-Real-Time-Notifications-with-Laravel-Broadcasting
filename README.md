# Project Overview

**Goal:** Set up a Laravel app that broadcasts an event when a new post is created. The event will be listened to by the frontend using Laravel Echo, and the updates will be displayed in real-time without refreshing the page.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Routing
- Sessions
- Caching
- Real-time event broadcasting

## Technologies

- **Laravel Echo** (Frontend)
- **Pusher** (WebSocket service)
- **Redis** (For broadcasting events)
